<h1>Joan Ganz Cooney</h1>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Joan Ganz Cooney, born on November 30, 1929, is the cofounder of the hit children series, <i>Sesame Street</i>. She grew up in an upper middle class family, often participating in school plays in high school. She pursued acting, but later in college she chose teaching because it was "acceptable" for a woman back then. After graduating college in 1951, she moved to Washington DC, where she worked a series of many jobs before she cofounded Sesame Street.</p>

<h3>The Creation of Sesame Street</h3>
<p>Sesame Street was founded in 1966 from ideas created by Joan Ganz Cooney ans Lloyd Morrisett, vice president of Carnegie Corporation. Their goal was to create a children's show to help children prepare for school. After two years, the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation and the U.S. federal government gave the Children's Television Workshop a budget of 8 million dollars to create and produce Sesame Street. The first episode aired on November 10, 1969, and the show took off soon after.</p>
